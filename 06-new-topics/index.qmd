# Overview


- With more data and computing resources, the things that we can ask and do with networks are becoming increasingly (even more) exciting and complex.

- In this section, I will introduce some of the latest advancements and forthcoming topics in network modeling.


## Multilevel ERGMs

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
- In @krivitskyTaleTwoDatasets2023a, the authors present a start-to-finish pooled ERGM example featuring heterogeneous data sources.

## Statistical power of SOAM

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
- **SOAM** @stadtfeldStatisticalPowerLongitudinal2020 proposes ways to perform power analysis for Siena models. At the center of their six-step approach is simulation.

## Bayesian ALAAM

Ever wondered how to model influence exclusively?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- The Auto-Logistic Actor Attribute Model [ALAAM] is a model that allows us to do just that.
:::

::: {.column}
- **ALAAM** @koskinenBayesianAnalysisSocial2022 extends the ALAAM model to a Bayesian framework, providing greater flexibility to accommodate more complicated models and add extensions such as hierarchical models.

## Relational Event Models

- **REM** @buttsRelationalEventModels2023 provides a general overview of Relational Event Models [REMs,] new methods, and future steps.


## Big ERGMs

- **ERGMs** In @stivalaExponentialRandomGraph2020a, a new method is proposed to estimate large ERGMs (featuring millions of nodes). 


## ERGMitos: Small ERGMs

- **ERGMitos**[^ito] [@vegayonExponentialRandomGraph2021] leverage small network sizes to use exact statistics.

[^ito]: From the Spanish suffix meaning small.


## Exponential Random *Network* Models

- **ERNMs** Wang, Fellows, and Handcock recently published a re-introduction of the ERNM framework [@wangUnderstandingNetworksExponentialfamily2023]. ERNMs generalize ERGMs to incorporate behavior and are the cross-sectional causing of SIENA models.

## Thanks!

## Bonus track: Why network scientists don't use ERGMs?

> Attempts to overcome these problems by extending the blockmodel have focused particularly on the use of (more complicated) pâˆ— or exponential random graph models, but **while these are conceptually appealing**, they quickly **lose the analytic tractability** of the original blockmodel **as their complexity increases**.
